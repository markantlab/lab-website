In the Markant Lab we conduct research on core cognitive processes involved in learning, memory, and decision making, and explore their role in real-world problems related to  health, education, and human-computer interaction. How do people adapt to their environment to be more successful? How do we represent and reason about uncertainty? How do our existing beliefs  and attitudes shape the way we explore and make sense of the world? We examine these fundamental questions about human cognition from several angles as seen in the project descriptions below. Ultimately, our research has the common goal of enhancing human learning and wellbeing through a better understanding of how people interact with and learn from the world around them. 

In support of the core scientific questions above, the lab engages in activities related to:
- Behavioral experiments in the lab and online
- Design and programming of experimental tasks and games
- Computational modeling of cognition and behavior
- Open and reproducible science
- Data science-y skills involved in working with behavioral data, including statistical programming
- Pedagogical research on research methods and statistical thinking

The lab typically includes students from graduate programs in Cognitive Science, Psychology, Health Psychology, and Computer Science. Undergraduate research assistants are welcome from any area as long as they have an interest in cognitive science or a closely related field and are motivated to learn about the work we’re doing in the lab.

## Constructing abstract conceptual knowledge through experience





## Learning about the Self


A great deal of research in psychology and other fields have shown that people often exhibit a range of confirmation biases, such that they seek out information or interpret evidence in a way that is likely to reinforce their existing beliefs. One manifestation of this is known as self-verification, in which people (knowingly or not) favor information or feedback that will confirm existing self-views. For instance, when given the opportunity to hear positive or negative evaluations, people with low self-esteem have been shown to prefer negative feedback, even though it reinforces existing, negative beliefs about themselves. Past work suggests that self-verification creates a self-fulfilling feedback loop in which people with negative self-views pay more attention (or put more trust in) negative feedback, which strengthens those views further. 

Why do people self-verify, particularly when it means hearing something negative about oneself? In an ongoing project, we are examining the role of emotion regulation processes in the decision about whether to seek out positive or negative feedback about oneself. The eventual goal of this line of research is to identify strategies for providing feedback that make people more receptive to feedback that conflicts with existing self-views.
