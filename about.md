[CV](/assets/markant_cv.pdf)

I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://psych.uncc.edu">Department of Psychological Science
</a> at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. 
Prior to this I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality">Center for Adaptive Rationality</a>, within the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. 
In January 2014 I completed my Ph.D. in the <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/programs/cp/">Cognition and Perception</a> program at New York University.

I’m interested in how minds make learning possible. The aim of my research is to understand cognitive processes involved in human learning and decision making, how those processes are shaped by one’s environment, and what they imply for real-world learning problems (especially educational practices). 

For more information on our research, please see the list of [publications](/publications).
