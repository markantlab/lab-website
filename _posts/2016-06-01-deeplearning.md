Partial review of *Deep Learning*, a book by Stellan Ohlsson. This is not a book about recent neural network techniques. This is somewhat unfortunate choice, although maybe it’ll draw more people to this book (which is excellent).

Summarize the overall argument--what does Ohlsson mean by “deep learning”? 

The section I found most interesting was the section on insight. 

What is insight problem solving? Why is it interesting? Sudden changes, lack of metacognitive awareness of how far you are from solving a problem. 

How are impasses overcome?


# Where do new ideas come from?

Real challenge.
