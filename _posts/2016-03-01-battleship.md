Commuting, usually read while taking the train. I often get engrossed in what I'm reading and lose track of where the train is. But at each stop I have to make a decision as to whether to get off the train. How do I do this?

Turns out that here in Berlin, lots of subway stops have a very reliable, distinctive cue that indicates where you are: the tiling on the walls. This is especially true at the stop preceding the point where I have to switch trains, which is a kind of striped pastel pattern that is very distinct. 

So just need a quick glance out the window to figure out where I am, and that it's not yet time to get off the train.

Note that this particular search decision (looking at the wall pattern as opposed to any other features of the environment) is tuned to that particular part of the environment. The same strategy doesn't work as well for my next decision about getting off the train: the last two stops of my trip have very similar wall patterns, so I usually find myself spending more time looking for other distinctive cues, like pictures on the wall or signs with the name of the station.

This example is pretty mundane, but that is one reason I like it: we are constantly making these decisions throughout our daily life. They reflect a kind of hypothesis testing in which our uncertainty rises above some threshold and drives us to gather relevant bits of data from the environment. It may not be quite the same as how we usually think of hypothesis testing, which is something closer to scientific reasoning about theories and designing experiments that tell them apart. But it shows how uncertainty is a useful force that guides our attention to the right places and at the right time.

How does this process work? How does our uncertainty about the state of the environment guide our exploration?

We examined this using a variant of the board game Battleship.
