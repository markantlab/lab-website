Next month I’ll be participating in a full-day workshop at CogSci,
entitled [“Active learning: Cognitive development, education, and 
computational models.”](https://sites.google.com/site/activelearningworkshop16/home)
The workshop will feature lots of terrific researchers from the CogSci community 
who have been thinking about active learning from many angles.
Come by if you are in Philly on Wednesday!
